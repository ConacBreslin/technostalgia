# **Technostalgia - a website where you can reminisce about obsolete technologies**
Technologies are developing at an unprecedented pace. It is easy to forget about older technologies that were once cutting edge but that have been replaced by newer, faster and run the risk of being forgotten. This webpage give people the opportuntity to look at older tcehnologies, comment on them and add other technologies to the website.

## User Experience (UX)

### Project Goals

#### Visitor Goals
On visiting the site a visitor should be able to  
1. Understand what the website is about.
2. View all technologies on the site, or view by category, or select specific technologies.
3. Users should be able to register for the website.
4. Users should be able to login to the website.
5. Logged in users should be able to post new technologies.
6. Logged in users should be able to edit and delete their own additions to the site.
7. Logged in users should be able to post comments on technologies.
8. Logged in users should be able to edit and delete comments on technologies.
9. Logged in users should be able to Logout easily.
10. The site administrator should be able to add new categories to teh site and these should automatically be included in all menus.

#### Registered User goals

#### Developer and Business goals

#### USer Stories

## Strategy
The site should be a simple and attractive  with sufficient activity to engage visitors, encourage them to sign up and return to the site.

Objective Requirement;         To encourage visitors to register with the site.

Functional requirements; 	    To provide a collection of technologies that users can view. To provide a facility for users to register, login an out of the site. To provide users with the facility to add, edit and delete their own technologies and comments.

Non-functional requirements; 	The site should be attractive and intuitive.

## Scope

## Structure
The site will have 9 pages, These will be welcome, registration, login, logout, browsing, add technology, edit techology, delete technology, inie page and a page for the final result. The quiz should automatically usher the player through all the stages of the quiz once they start through to the end. At the end they should be able to quit or replay.
## Skeleton
The welcome page  explains what the site is about and encourage visitors to register. 
The technology collections page should have the ability for teh visitor or member to view all the technologies or to view them by category. [here](assets/images/wireframes.pdf). 
## Surface/Design (Design Choices fonts, icons, colours, styling, backgroundss)

### Imagery
The overall image of the site was to be kept clear, simple and intuitive.
### Colour scheme
It was important to keep the colour scheme of the quiz extremely simple. Information on the [psychology of colours](https://www.vandelaydesign.com/the-psychology-of-color-in-web-design/) in website design indicates that blue can help convey trustworthiness and so a dark shade of blue was picked for the font. A [minimum contrast ratio](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/Understanding_WCAG/Perceivable/Color_contrast) of 4.5:1 for small text and 3:1 for large text is recommended. This site wanted a strong but not too stark contrast. The contrast ratio of the site is [11.14](assets/images/contrastratio.png). 
### Typography
Information on the [psychology of fonts](https://fabrikbrands.com/font-psychology-and-typography-inspiration-in-logo-design) indicated that a serif font can  convey trust and respectability. With this in mind the Vesper Libre font was selected in [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) for its simplicity.

## Testing.
Bugs identified during development and testing and their solutions can be seen [here](assets/images/buglog.png).
### Validation
- HTML and CSS. All pages of the quiz were tested by direct input into [validator.w3.org](https://validator.w3.org/) for html and [jigsaw.w3.org](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) for css and errors identified were corrected until no errors were showing in either validator. 
The javaScript in all the .js files was checked by direct input into [jshint](https://jshint.com/) and errors identified were corrected until no more corrections could be made. There were residual warnings about unused varaibles that had to be left as the variables were used in the code. The final jshint report can be viewed [here](assets/images/jshint.png).
- Lighthouse Audits. The quiz’s Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices and SEO were assessed by [Chrome Lighthouse](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lighthouse/blipmdconlkpinefehnmjammfjpmpbjk) and the results of this are [here](assets/images/lighthousereport.png).
- Manual Testing. Extensive use was made of console.log() at every step of the functionality development and each time an error was noted it was addressed before proceeeding.
The quiz was tested on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge and Safari browsers.
It was viewed on a variety of devices. Friends and family members reviewed the site to identify bugs and give feedback on user experience. The code was submitted for peer-review in Code Institute's peer-code-review channel in [slack.com](https://app.slack.com/).

## Changes over course of development

## Known Bugs

## Deployment
### The project was deployed to Heroku in the following way. 
In Heroku.com
1. 'New' was selected.
2. 'Create new app' was selected.
3. app-name was added and region selected
4. 'Create app' was selected.
5. The app was set up to automatically deploy from the associated GitHub repository by selecting the 'GitHub' Deployment method, ensuring the correct repository was selected, adding the repository name and clicking 'Search'. Once the correct repo is found 'Connect' was clicked
6. Before enabling automatic deployment Heroku had to be told the environment variables securely. This was done by clicking on 'Settings' for the app, selecting 'Reveal Config Vars' and adding the IP, PORT, SECRET_KEY, MONGO_URI and MONGO_DBNAME and clicking 'Hide Config Vars'.
7. In the Deploy tab of the app select 'Enable Automatic Deploys' and then as the project only has one branch 'main' was chosen as the branch to deploy and 'Deploy Branch' was selected. After a few minutes, when Heroku was received the code from GitHub and built the app a message appears saying 'Your app was successfully deployed.' The app is then deployed and automaytically updated when code is pushed to GitHub.

### Forking the GitHub Repository
The  GitHub Repository can be forked to make a copy of the original repository on the GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository in the following way.
1.	By logging in to GitHub and locating the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/ConacBreslin/Face-your-fears).
2.	Selecting the "Fork" button at the top of the Repository (it is located above the "Settings" Button and over to the right).
3.	There should then be a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

### Making a Local Clone
1.	By logging in to GitHub and locating the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/ConacBreslin/Face-your-fears).
2.	Under the repository name, clicking the dropdown button marked “Code” and then selecting "Clone or download".
3.	Copying the link under "Clone with HTTPS", to clone the repository using HTTPS.
4.	Opening Git Bash.
5.	Changing the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
6.	Typing git clone, and pasting the URL copied in Step 3.
7.	Pressing Enter to create the local clone.## Credits
